# House-of-Mobius

New technique working on the latest version of libc (glibc 2.40) and tested on glibc 2.35. I discovered this new vulnerability in malloc while participating in the France Cybersecurity Challenge CTF 2025 edition, in the challenge titled "configuration editor". You can find the write-up I wrote on the official Hackropole website: https://hackropole.fr/fr/challenges/pwn/fcsc2025-pwn-editeur-de-configuration/. A restriction in the challenge prevented writing after a null byte (\x00). I initially thought of using the technique presented in this repo, but eventually fell back on a classic House of Einherjar technique. This technique, which I named House of MÃ¶bius, is an advanced version of House of Einherjar, but with an abnormally large size that causes a consolidation loop around memory until it finds a chunk to consolidate with.
